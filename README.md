# Product Testing Project Overview

This project focuses on implementing unit tests for functions related to product management. These tests cover various functionalities such as adding, removing, updating, and displaying products,
ensuring their correctness and reliability.

# Purpose

The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate the importance of unit testing in ensuring the functionality and integrity of product management functions. By thoroughly testing these functions, 
including edge cases and error handling, we aim to enhance the quality and robustness of the product management system.

# Features

1) Unit tests for basic product management functions:
   
Adding a product

Removing a product

Updating product details

Displaying products

2) Unit tests for main application functionality:
Testing the main application flow

3) Comprehensive testing of edge cases and error scenarios to ensure robustness.
   
4) Integration of test cases with the product management system for seamless testing.
